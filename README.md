# CityPlanner-Project

This is my Go at the "Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox" from the Fullstack-Engineer Career Path.
I tried to make it look as professional as possible at the moment for me. Currentliy I'm at 15% in this Career Path,
and we've learned a lot about HTML, CSS and responsive design.
